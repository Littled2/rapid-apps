<h1>Making a new app</h1>


<h2>1. Setting up the environment</h2>

<p>
    All the code/resources for a particular app goes in specially labelled directories.
</p>

<p>
    Lets say we want to make a new app called *inventory*, which will be some kind of inventory management tool.
</p>

<p>Create the following directories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>`/webpages/inventory` For all your app's webpages.</li>
    <li>`/resources/inventory` For all your app's stylesheets, images, etc.</li>
    <li>`/backend/api/inventory` For all your app's API routes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. Making webpages for the app</h2>

<p>Create a `page.html` file at `/webpages/{your_app_name}/page.html`. This will be the entry point to your app.</p>

<p>All of the pages for this particular app must exist within`/webpages/{your_app_name}/`. The  same login applies to the app's api and resources directories also.</p>


<h2>3. Good luck</h2>
<p>No more rules, go have fun and build however you like!</p>
