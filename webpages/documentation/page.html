====================================

<h1>Rapid Sites Documentation</h1>

<p>Rapid sites was developed to help me focus on actually building things and keep those things running long term. Coding ideas pop into my brain frequently, and oftentimes I end up starting a new app with some large framework and ultimatley spend so much time getting the entire project setup from scratch that I get bored and stop. My other issue is that I seem to be generally bad at hosting things and my React app (for example) that requires a separate Node or Pocketbase backend ends up not even running long term.</p>

<p>Rapid sites gives me a platform to very quickly implement my coding ideas, and requires a bare minimum of upkeep. Not even a permanent running process (beyond Apache).</p>

<p>
    Rapid sites is divided into separate applications. So whenever you have a new coding idea, just make it as a new app.
